Hello! I am a PhD student at the [Earth from Above Lab](https://www.theearthfromabove.com/) at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I study the drivers and patterns of land-use change in open ecosystems in India. I love writing (you can read some of my published work [here](https://anishajayadevan.rbind.io/writing/) and organizing public science talks (more [here](https://cafeoikos.wordpress.com/)).

I was part of the collaborative effort to bring out an illustrated book on urban biodiversity in India titled [The Living Museum](cafeoikos.wordpress.com/book/).
