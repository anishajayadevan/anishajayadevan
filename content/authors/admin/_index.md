Hello! I am a PhD student at the [Earth from Above Lab](https://www.theearthfromabove.com/) at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I study land-use change in grasslands in India. I also love writing (you can read some of my published work [here](/writing.md)) and organizing public science talks (more [here](https://cafeoikos.wordpress.com/)).
