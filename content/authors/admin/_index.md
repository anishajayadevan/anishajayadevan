Hello! I am a PhD student at the [Earth from Above Lab](https://www.theearthfromabove.com/) at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I study the drivers and patterns of land-use change in open ecosystems in India. I also love writing (you can read some of my published work [here](/writing.md)) and organizing public science talks (more [here](https://cafeoikos.wordpress.com/)).

In October 2022, I co-created an illustrated book on urban biodiversity titled [The Living Museum](cafeoikos.wordpress.com/book/), along with a multi-talented group of women from India.
